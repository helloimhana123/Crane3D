TODO:

    1. Figure out what conditional_deselect is.
    2. Investigate up/down perspective.
    3. Don't marquee select hidden (by geo) items.
    4. Clicking and dragging on a face/vert/edge with control down, will deselect other faces.
       Should be fixed by selecting on mouse up, and allowing marquee select even when over an item.
